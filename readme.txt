This is a shiny app that allows the user to choose from a selection of audio files 
which are initially downloaded as a zip file (< 500KB). The app display plots of 
waveforms and spectrograms of one of the audio files, selected with a radio button.

 
The user can also select a window size, used for calculation of the spectrogram:
 
A larger window (bigger value) gives better frequency resolution in the spectrogram,
allowing the user to see the individual resonant frequencies of the source of the 
sound as narrow horizontal bands across the spectrogram (but this is at the expense
of temporal resolution). 

A narrower window (smaller value) gives better temporal resolution, allowing the user
to see more precisely when each element of the sound was produced (but this is at the
expense of frequency resolution). 

All audio files provided with this app were originally downloaded from http://www.wavsource.com/
